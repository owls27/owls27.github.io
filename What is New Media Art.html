    <h1>New Blood</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify">
    New media art is a word only available in this day and age. It is based onelectronic technology carriers like computers, smartphones and etc. Compared to manykinds of art in the old age, new media art broke away from traditional art materials andentered the stage of digital media and electronic technology. The reason why newmedia art could be considered as new is it makes enough progress in new areas of art.This indicates that artists of new media art must focus their development direction oncomplex sensory enjoyment in order to achieve success because artists in the new eracan rely on new technologies to satisfy their ideas to enrich all aspects of artworks, soas to achieve composite sensory enjoyment effects.This is something that old artistscouldn't do. There are also some new media art artists who have perfected one of thecharacteristics of their works to an extreme level, which can also make their worksstand out. In fact, in this era of rapid development, there is a very fierce competition inthe field of new media art.There are few new media art that can truly shock the worldand lead the new trend.These new blood give the world a different experience.</P>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
    The first new media artist I want to mention is Hidetaka Miyazaki with ​Dark Souls​.The game ​Dark Souls​ is an action role-playing game produced by Japanese videogame company From Software. This game is also the spiritual sequel to the gameDemon Soul​, the first work in the Soul series. The story of ​Dark Souls​ takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran. The player takes roll as a cursed undead imprisoned inNorthern Undead Asylum, who would be accidentally released by a mysterious personand embarks on an adventure of his own destiny. ​Dark Souls​ received wide acclaimimmediately after its release, and it is considered one of the best video games. Criticspraised its sense of combat combat, intricate world design and deep sense ofsubstitution. However, the difficulty of the game has received different reviews. Althoughsome people praise the game’s difficult challenges, others criticize that it does notrequire such a high degree of difficulty. FromSoftware announced that ​Dark Souls​ hadsold 2.37 million copies. So far, ​Dark Souls​ is considered to be one of the mostoutstanding video games in the seventh generation consoles. Due to the success ofDark Souls, many games are influenced by the Soul series. This type of games thatdraw on the features of ​Dark Souls​ are called Souls-Like games; in particular, severalworks developed by From Software are collectively called Souls Series. This series ofnames was originally discussed and used by the player group, but then it was alsoenriched by researchers and developers for its definition, such as level design and playexperience. Some game platforms have also begun to call this category of games asSouls-Like games. I think the reason why Dark Souls have been so successful is thatHideko Miyazaki takes the artistic value of games to a new level. Miyazaki is veryaction-oriented. The hit sense and action performance of his games are very good.Healso made the game harder than ever before. He even set a precedent in the world ofgaming, allowing players to leave text messages on the map to other players, either aswell-meaning hints or as "CARES" that could kill you.These small ideas give the players an unexpected surprise. In addition to the action elements, the setting of characters andworldview setting has a new interpretation, refreshing.The player interprets the game'sworldview from a third party perspective as an unknown person.The intricate andingenious map design is even more immersive, and the overall style tends to be darkand bloody. What impresses me most is that players won’t get a full synopsis of thestory, it's all broken up into fragments, and they might be hidden in a forgotten corpse,in a deep corner of a dungeon. Even a Boss who players would challenge is a characterplayers have met before. Only by constantly getting stronger, going through every placeof the game and to defeat the powerful boss in the game, can you understand the grandand great world of ​Dark Souls​ by associating all the plot fragments. When players finishthe game, thinking back to the epic they wrote, often can be moved to their own. This isa game that allows players to move themselves. ​Dark Souls​ really belongs to newmedia art. "Pass it on and the flame will not die out."</P>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
    In my imagination, highly difficult action games are very unique, and the difficultyof the Boss is very difficult to control.The Dark Souls series is a good reference.Withthis in mind, I strongly hope that I have the ability to build a world that is different from the Dark Souls world, but with the same level of grandeur.</p>

    The second New Media Art artist also made achievements in the field of games. Chinese gamers call him the "Light of the Chinese". Xinghan Chen, knownprofessionally as Jenova Chen, is a Chinese game designer. He is the designer of theaward-winning games ​Cloud​, ​Flow​, ​Flower​, and ​Journey​, and he is the co-founder ofThatgamecompany. Chen was born in a different culture from the one he lives in. Hetries to create games that appeal to everyone. His goal is to help video games becomea mature medium that elicit emotional responses. Although he could and havedeveloped more traditional games, he doesn't have any plans to develop themcommercially because he believes that's inconsistent with their goals as an independentvideo game developer. Chen has had an unprecedented impact on the new style Zenart games. People play games for a variety of reasons. Some people want to realizetheir grand fantasy, while others want to vent their emotions through some headshots.Still others play games now because they want to relax, to get some zen to relievetension. They find refuge in video games, especially those called Zen. Zen is living inthe present moment. Enjoy the moment without worrying about what's behind or ahead.Zen in video games is something similar. It puts our brain in suspended, relaxed andeven automatic mode. After a long day of work or study, Zen play is a process thatslows down your brain. Zen is very individualistic, the zen kept in each person’s mind might be totally different, which means that what players get from the zen game are alsodifferent. That's part of the charm of zen games. Personally, I like ​Journey​ very much.Four different scenes correspond to different weather and terrain. The game landscapeis dominated by spectacular style, which makes people sigh at every moment.Themovements of the characters are mostly sliding and smooth, which makes people feelvery comfortable.The great thing about this game is that it has a matching mechanism.Players always tell a joke that If a player is confused looking at the landscape on themap, it will match another player who is also confused and at a loss.It is a variety offeelings very subtle, like in the vast sea floated for a month finally met the living, twopeople together to meet the unknown fate of the feeling. I still remember the first time Imet another player, I thought I met an NPC, excitedly rushed to say something, but onlysent out a string of strange characters. Later, I found out that this person was notprogrammed and that was a player like me. In a word, the appearance of Zen Gamerepresents that the appeal of new media art to users not only focuses on fun, but alsogives users or players a comfortable and pleasant experience.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
    Zen games have always been a game that makes me sigh.And the performanceof Journey moved me even more.I'd love to come up with a Zen game but it takes avery long time of mental and creative effort on the part of the designer.This blueprint isextremely difficult for me, and I think it will be one of my goals in life.</p>

    The last thing I want to talk about is the artist who designed Pokemon Go,Dennis Hwang. Once known as "the world's most famous unknown artist," he was incharge of designing Google Doodles. He often used informative multimedia content thatexisted in the Google logo on the company's search pages. Since then, his buildingplans have got bigger: Mr Hwang is the director of visual design at Niantic Labs, acompany that spun off Google a year ago and then went on to throw at a small mobilegame called ​PokémonGo​ in July. With ​PokémonGo​, he said that he thinks the world ishis game board. Talking about it, people always talk about the development of ARtechnology. Augmented Reality refers to the technology that enables the virtual world onscreen to interact with the real world scene through actuarial calculation of the positionand Angle of the camera image and image analysis technology.This technique wasintroduced in 1990.As the computing power of portable electronic devices improves,augmented reality is becoming more and more useful. I am very sure that ARtechnology is new media art. Not only because it has made great progress in a newfield, but also because it adds a way of interaction between human and virtualfantasy.I'm really looking forward to the AR technology in the future that will allow us toadd more relevance to the electronic virtual world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
    According to the introduction of my course ART75, I seem to be able to learn ARtechnology in a short time.This means That I can learn AR technology well and makemy own works.Pokemon Go's AR interaction seems to be perfect for me tolearn.Random pets show up, feed, train, and amuse.Play pet battles like Pokemon Gotrainers.I think There are a few things that I can learn that give my work its strengths.</p>

    All three of the artists I recommend have established themselves in gaming.Hidetaka Miyazaki's difficult game design and magnificent world view design fascinatedme. Jenova Chen's understanding of the Zen Game has enabled me to enjoy relaxationin the game. (compared to Dark Souls) I was addicted to Dennis Hwang's Pokemon Gowhen it took the world by storm. These three game designers that I admire have proveninvaluable to me. I am also determined to become a qualified game designer. Finally,the emergence of New media art is absolutely a precious treasure for us young people.Digital media is a way for us to realize our dreams.</p>
