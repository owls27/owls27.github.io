    Hi,I am Jianda Zhen. You can call me Vorsen. I am a new student at SJSU transferred from City College of San Francisco. My major is Digital Media Art. The reason why I choose this major is that Art design or game design has been my dream for many years. I love playing video games, and I think I'll love it for the rest of my life. But At the same time, I think I should pay more and get more in my favorite field. Even I started to think how to build up a game by myself. Now I have a chance to learn it up. ART 74 is a good preparing class for me.
