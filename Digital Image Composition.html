    The project I did this time was quite simple. It is about a duel of the century between an evil dragon and a righteous superman. I use a runied city as a background so that it emphasizes that the fight is really powerful. To show there are two sides called evil and justice, I set a line to separate my work from middle. And the title is there. I set the two materials in the opposite direction to form the battle screen. In addition, I added two cuboids and edited them into Superman's red-eye ray to attack the dragon. I really like this science fiction theme. But I'm looking forward to being able to learn better techniques and do better work.
